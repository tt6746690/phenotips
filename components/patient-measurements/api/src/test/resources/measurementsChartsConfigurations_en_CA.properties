# Override each setting with valid values

# Most of the settings have valid default values, only specify the mandatory ones

# Check that the left<->right and top<->bottom labels are duplicated when only one of each pair is present

# Some broken or exotic values, which will be ignored, although the global configuration is still valid

# Errors that will be checked and reported, making these settings invalid
# This includes missing mandatory values

# This isn't listed, so it should be ignored
